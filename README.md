# Hangman


## Description
Hi! Here are several files of the Hangman game that i've done some month ago in 3 languages (Python, Java and C), I've done this because i was bored and wanted to improve my programming skill by doing the same game in different languages. 

It is ran in the terminal (no GUI), the goal is to guess a word chosen in the dictionnary, the game contains only french words, so if you want to change the language or/and add some new words, you have to manually edit the "minidico.txt" file
